# M2E Settings

Provide consistent Eclipse IDE settings for your team from a Maven POM.
The M2E Settings plugin will copy formatting, findbugs and other plugin
settings from a centrally maintained settings JAR to your workspace and
configure each project to use those settings.

 - uses the Maven Eclipse Plugin settings as a base
 - configure once, set everywhere
 - version control your settings

Many thanks to [Olivier Nouguier](https://github.com/cheleb) for the
[first version of this plugin](https://github.com/cheleb/m2e-settings).

This project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/topicusonderwijs/m2e-settings/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

### Alternative

[m2e-code-quality](https://github.com/m2e-code-quality/m2e-code-quality) is a similar alternative project to this one, which you may find of interest to look at if you are reading this.  While this project here applies settings from `.settings/*.prefs` files to Eclipse, that project maps a (known limited set of) other Maven plugins' configurations to Eclipse settings (with the advantage that you'll have the same settings in the mvn CLI build and the IDE).

## Installation

Update site URL:

 - https://github.com/topicusonderwijs/m2e-settings/raw/master/site

### Eclipse Marketplace

The plugin is also available from [Eclipse Marketplace](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-settings).
Just open up the marketplace search and search for `M2E Settings`.

### Installing the Eclipse plugin

- Add a new update site to your Eclipse settings:
- Select "Install new software" (OS X: under Help)
- Click "Add"
- Fill in the Name field: "M2E Settings plugin"
- Fill in the Location field: "https://github.com/topicusonderwijs/m2e-settings/raw/master/site"
- Click "OK"
- Click "Next" ad infinitum

## Configuration

There are three steps to configure the M2E Settings:

1. Create (and deploy) your own settings jar
2. Configure the M2E settings plugin in your project
3. Re-import the Maven projects in Eclipse

### Create your own settings jar

Create a project for your own settings jar. This project will only
contain the relevant Eclipse settings files for your plugins.

#### Create a Maven project

First create an empty Maven project, and put this in the POM to build
your settings jar (adjust the values for your own settings jar).

``` xml
<project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <prerequisites>
        <maven>3.0.4</maven>
    </prerequisites>
    <groupId>com.example.settings</groupId>
    <artifactId>eclipse-settings</artifactId>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <build>
        <defaultGoal>package</defaultGoal>
        <resources>
            <resource>
                <directory>files</directory>
                <filtering>false</filtering>
                <includes>
                    <include>**/*</include>
                </includes>
            </resource>
        </resources>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

This configures Maven to look in the `files` folder for resources and
package them into the resulting jar.

#### Add your settings to the JAR

Now you can copy the various Eclipse settings from the `.settings`
folders into the files folder:

``` bash
$ ls settings-project/files
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff     55 Jul  7 17:52 edu.umd.cs.findbugs.plugin.eclipse.prefs
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff    529 Jul  7 17:52 org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff    175 Jul  7 17:52 org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.prefs
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff  31543 Jul  7 17:52 org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff  11723 Jul  7 17:52 org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff     86 Jun 29 23:47 org.eclipse.m2e.core.prefs
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff    411 Jun 29 23:52 org.eclipse.wst.common.component
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff    167 Jun 29 23:52 org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff    382 Jul  7 17:52 org.eclipse.wst.validation.prefs
-rw-r--r--   1 dashorst  staff    232 Jul  7 17:52 org.maven.ide.eclipse.prefs
```

You can repeat this every time a new version of Eclipse comes out, and
update all settings to new defaults.

#### Deploy to a Maven repository

Now you can upload the jar to a Maven repository using `mvn deploy`. Or
use the Maven release plugin to create releases of your settings jar.

### Configure M2E settings in your project

The M2E Settings plugin retrieves the Eclipse workspace settings from
the [Maven Eclipse Plugin][1] configuration. The easiest way to provide
these settings is to create a resource JAR file and distribute that
from a Maven repository.

You then specify your 'settings JAR' file as a dependency to the
*maven-eclipse-plugin*:

``` xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.9</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.example.settings</groupId>
            <artifactId>eclipse-settings</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
```

As the M2E Settings plugin needs to be bound to a Maven lifecycle, and
the most common lifecycle is the compile lifecycle, you also need to
specify the maven-compiler-plugin in your POM. At the minimum you'll 
need:

``` xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
</plugin>
```

#### Putting the settings in the right place

The *maven-eclipse-plugin* allows you to [move settings files from one
location to another][2]. You use that to put each configuration file
from your settings JAR in the right location:

``` xml
<plugin>
    <...>
    <configuration>
        <additionalConfig>
            <file>
                <name>.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs</name>
                <location>/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs</location>
            </file>
            <file>
                <name>.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs</name>
                <location>/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs</location>
            </file>
            <!-- and more... -->
        </additionalConfig>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### Re-import projects in Eclipse

Now we have modified the projects, you have to re-import the projects
in Eclipse. Typically this is done by:

 - selecting all projects,
 - right-clicking on the selection and
 - clicking "Maven â†’ Update project"

## Releasing

If you are a developer of this project and have made some modifications use
this guide to build a release to distribute it to the users.

### Building a release

Run the release shell script from the root folder of the m2e-settings
project:

``` bash
./release.sh
```

This script performs the following steps:

- assign a new release version number to the current workspace
- create a new distribution of the new version in the current workspace
- create an updated P2 repository in the current workspace
- commit all these results into the git repository

This doesn't push the intermediate results to github, this is a manual
step you have to do to release a new version.

## Uploading a release

When you have checked the release and it is found OK, then you can
upload the new version to github and instruct your team to perform an
update:

```
git push
```

This will push the changes to github and publish a new update site to
the update site URL.
